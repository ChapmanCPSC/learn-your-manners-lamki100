Beverages drunk at the table and at parties have a set of manners all their own, and some guidelines apply across the board:\n-Take a drink only when you have no food in your mouth;\n-Sip instead of gulping;\n-if you're a woman, don't wear so much lipstick that your drinking glass will become smudged."
