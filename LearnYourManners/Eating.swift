At a formal or business meal, you should either wait until everyone is served to start or begin when the host asks you to.\n\nHANDLING UTENSILS:\nThe continental table manners style prevails at all meals, formal and informal, because it is a natural, non-disruptive way to eat.\n\n-Hold your fork in your left hand, tines downward.\n-Use your fork to spear and lift food to your mouth.\n-If your knife is not needed, it remains on the table.\n\nAt informal meals the dinner fork may be held tines upward, American table manners style."
